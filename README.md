# OWL Tokens and Contenders Skins farmer bot

Highly experimental and heavily work-in-progress implementation of YouTube league token bot that uses actual browser to watch streams. Downloadable executable later.

There is headless mode that is console only (no browser window!) and I am not sure whether YouTube can detect it.

I will add more info on how to use this bot to this Readme later.
